# Ecommerce Admin Panel

What application does?

<a href="https://adminpanelfrontend.onrender.com">ADMIN PANEL</a> was created to easily manage products on the website and have quick access to statistics, e.g. website traffic, products sold, product availability on the website, user lists, user permissions management, etc.

The goal of this Admin Panel is to be quick and easy interaction with data and content. I tried to make the interface relatively simpler, more intuitive and understandable, so that the user could perform their tasks faster and analyze the data presented on the dashboard.
